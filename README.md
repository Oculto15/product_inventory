# Overview

In this project, I am trying to develop a program where users can store their products on a database. They will have the ability to create, search, update, and delete by using the ID.

This program, which was written in Java, is connected to the MySQL server to store all information provided by the user.

The purpose of writing this software is to have the experience of creating a Java project with the respective form to have a visual screen for the program, and to be able to connect to a database and use SQL commands to manipulate the data.

# Relational Database

This project initially consisted of a straightforward database with four rows: ID, product name, price, and quantity.

# Development Environment

I create my Java statements using IntelliJ, and I save all of the data on a MySQL server. A key component of my project is the use of online sources. I devoted a significant amount of time to mastering Java's connection and SQL statements.

# Useful Websites

Some of the useful websites I have used are as follows:
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)
* [javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/example-to-connect-to-the-mysql-database)
* [ORACLE](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/processingsqlstatements.html)


# Future Work

Some of the things I would like to implement in the future are:
* I will implement different views for the options to delete, update, and create. I will keep the search option as the main option.
* I will implement different tables to be able to create join statistics.
